1. **Database Schema Configuration**
   - Created `profiles` table for user data with JSON profile_data field
   - Created `products` table with all required fields including JSON attributes
   - Set up appropriate indexes for efficient queries

   - Added function to get product categories with counts
   - Added advanced product search function with filtering
   - Added featured products function

3. **Client Integration Files**
   - Created Supabase client configuration in `frontend/src/lib/supabase.js`
   - Added authentication helpers for signup, login, and session management

4. **Sample Data**
   - Added seed data script with 12 sample products across various categories

5. **Documentation**
   - Provided comprehensive README with setup instructions

2. Apply the schema, functions, and seed data
3. Set up environment variables with Supabase credentials
4. Test the authentication flow (next task)
5. Test product data access
