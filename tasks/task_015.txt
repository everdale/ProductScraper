# Description: Create a simple AI assistant for answering product questions
# Details:
Develop a basic AI assistant that can answer questions about products:

1. LLM Integration:
   - Set up connection to an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI API)
   - Create an endpoint to handle user queries about products
   - Implement secure API key management and usage tracking

2. Prompt Engineering:
   - Design effective prompt templates for product queries
   - Create a system that combines user questions with product data
   - Implement context handling for follow-up questions
   - Ensure responses are helpful and accurate

3. Query Processing:
   - Parse natural language queries to extract key information
   - Map queries to appropriate product data in the database
   - Format product information for inclusion in prompts
   - Implement response parsing and formatting

4. Features:
   - Product information lookup
   - Basic comparisons between similar products
   - Answering questions about features, specifications, and pricing
   - Handling ambiguous or incomplete questions

Focus on creating a simple but effective assistant that provides helpful responses about products in the database.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various product-related questions and verify the accuracy and helpfulness of responses. Evaluate the system's ability to handle different query types, including specific product lookups, comparison requests, and general product information questions.
