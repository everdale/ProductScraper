# Task ID: 16
# Title: Create Simple Product Comparison
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to compare similar products
# Details:
Develop a simple product comparison feature:

1. Backend Logic:
   - Create algorithms to identify similar products for comparison
   - Implement attribute matching across different products
   - Develop comparison matrix generation for key attributes
   - Create API endpoints to retrieve comparison data

2. Comparison Features:
   - Side-by-side comparison of product specifications
   - Highlight key differences between products
   - Support for comparing products across similar categories
   - Format comparison results in a user-friendly structure

3. Technical Implementation:
   - Develop normalization techniques for different attribute formats
   - Create a flexible comparison template system
   - Implement a scoring system for determining product similarity
   - Optimize comparison logic for performance

Start with a simpler version focusing on direct attribute comparison rather than AI analysis. Design the system to be extensible for more sophisticated comparisons in future iterations.

# Test Strategy:
Test with multiple product pairs from various categories to verify meaningful comparisons are generated. Check that key differences are accurately highlighted. Verify that the comparison data is structured in a way that can be easily presented in the frontend.
