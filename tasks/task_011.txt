# Task ID: 11
# Title: Set Up Supabase Project
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and configure the Supabase project for user management and product data
# Details:
Create a new Supabase project for the Svea AI Application. Configure authentication settings to allow email/password login. Set up database tables for users and products with the following schema:

1. Users Table:
   - id (primary key)
   - email
   - created_at
   - profile_data (JSON)

2. Products Table:
   - id (primary key)
   - name
   - description
   - price
   - image_url
   - category
   - attributes (JSON for category-specific properties)
   - created_at
   - source_url (the URL of the product on the original e-commerce site)

Create necessary indexes for efficient queries. Configure row-level security policies to protect user data.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful connection to Supabase from the application. Test authentication flows (signup, login, password reset). Confirm database tables are properly created with correct schemas.
