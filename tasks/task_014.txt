# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create Product API with FastAPI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop REST API endpoints for product data access
# Details:
Implement FastAPI endpoints for retrieving and searching products:

1. Core API Endpoints:
   - GET /products - List all products with pagination
   - GET /products/{id} - Get a specific product by ID
   - GET /products/search - Search products with filtering capabilities
   - GET /products/categories - Get list of available product categories

2. Filtering Features:
   - Implement filtering by category, price range, and attributes
   - Add sorting capabilities (price, name, newest)
   - Create pagination with customizable page size
   - Support for text search across product names and descriptions

3. API Design:
   - Ensure endpoints return consistent JSON format
   - Add proper error handling and status codes
   - Implement request validation
   - Document the API with OpenAPI/Swagger

4. Security & Performance:
   - Add authentication requirements for protected endpoints
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Optimize query performance for large result sets

Design the API to be extensible for future product attributes and categories.

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints with various query parameters and verify response structure and data accuracy. Test pagination, filtering, and sorting to ensure they work correctly. Verify error handling for invalid requests and authentication protection for secured endpoints.
