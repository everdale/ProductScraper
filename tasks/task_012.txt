# Title: Implement User Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create authentication flow using Supabase Auth
# Details:
Implement complete authentication functionality using Supabase Auth:

1. Backend Components:
   - Create authentication middleware for API routes
   - Set up secure token handling and validation
   - Implement session management for logged-in users

2. Frontend Components:
   - Create signup form with email validation
   - Implement login form with proper error handling
   - Add password reset functionality
   - Design and implement user profile page with basic information

3. Security Considerations:
   - Implement proper password policies
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Set up secure cookie handling
   - Ensure proper error messages that don't reveal sensitive information

Store user profile information in the previously created users table and implement proper session management.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete authentication flow including signup with email validation, login with correct credentials, login with incorrect credentials, password reset, and session persistence. Verify token-based API authentication works correctly with protected routes.
