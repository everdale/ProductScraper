# Development Plan for MVP Application

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

1. **Project Structure**:
   - [x] Set up a Git repository for version control.
   - [x] Organize the project into backend, frontend, and database directories.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - [x] Install necessary Python packages like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and requests.

## Phase 2: Web Scraping Development

1. **Scraping Logic Development**:
   - [ ] Develop a Python script to scrape product data from Webhallen and Kjell.
   - [ ] Use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to parse HTML and extract data.
   - [ ] Implement error handling and logging for robustness.

2. **Compliance**:
   - [ ] Ensure scraping complies with the terms of service of Webhallen and Kjell.

## Phase 3: Requirements and Planning

1. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - [ ] Define the specific product categories and types to scrape based on initial scraping results.
   - [ ] Identify the key data points to extract (e.g., product name, price, availability, specifications).

2. **Technology Stack Selection**:
   - [ ] **Backend**: Python with Flask for API development.
   - [ ] **Frontend**: React for building the user interface.
   - [ ] **Database**: Supabase for storing product data and user orders.
   - [ ] **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for scraping.

## Phase 4: Backend Development

1. **API Development**:
   - [ ] Set up a Flask application with RESTful endpoints.
   - [ ] Create endpoints to trigger scraping and retrieve product data.
   - [ ] Implement authentication and authorization if needed.

2. **Database Integration**:
   - [ ] Design a database schema to store product information and user orders.
   - [ ] Use Supabase to manage the database and connect it to the backend.

## Phase 5: Frontend Development

1. **UI Design**:
   - [ ] Design a user-friendly interface using React.
   - [ ] Implement features to search for products, view details, and place orders.

2. **Additional Features**:
   - [ ] Add a tab for comparing similar products.
   - [ ] Implement a "news" tab to display updates or new products.

## Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - [ ] Write tests for the scraping logic, API endpoints, and frontend components.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - [ ] Test the entire application flow from scraping to ordering.

## Phase 7: Deployment and Maintenance

1. **Deployment**:
   - [ ] Deploy the application to a cloud provider or local server for testing.
   - [ ] Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

2. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - [ ] Implement monitoring to track application performance and errors.
   - [ ] Plan for regular updates and maintenance.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement product comparison features.
- [ ] Add a "news" tab for updates and new products.
- [ ] Explore additional web-shops for scraping.
- [ ] Enhance the ordering system with more features.
